      "answer": "Yes! Just click the “gift” option on our website and fill out your invoice address and the delivery address of the person you want to surprise with Upcrate. Your loved one is going to receive a previous box or current box... and they’ll even find a Captain Crate card with their name and yours inside! All gift boxes ship twice a week."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a gift box and a regular subscription?",
